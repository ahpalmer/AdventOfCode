Advent of Code 2025.  I'm writing this in python.  I'm using AI to help me build the project structure, but not solve the puzzles

Notes on the structure of the project:
I'm using poetry to run the venv and structure.
To activate the venv: 
'poetry env activate' will give you the command to run, then you run that command

If you want to do all of this with one line: Invoke-Expression (poetry env activate)
